## Introduction

Dynamic Programming (DP) is usually used to solve optimization problems. The only way to get better at DP is to practice. It takes some amount of practice to be able to recognize that a problem can be solved by DP.

## Learning resources

- [Demystifying Dynamic Programming](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/demystifying-dynamic-programming-3efafb8d4296)
- [Dynamic Programming – 7 Steps to Solve any DP Interview Problem](https://dev.to/nikolaotasevic/dynamic-programming--7-steps-to-solve-any-dp-interview-problem-3870)
- [Less Repetition, More Dynamic Programming](https://medium.com/basecs/less-repetition-more-dynamic-programming-43d29830a630), basecs
- [Dynamic Programming](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/classes/223/notes.html#dynamicProgramming), James Aspnes, Yale University

## Techniques

Sometimes you do not need to store the whole DP table in memory, the last two values or the last two rows of the matrix will suffice.

## Essential questions

_These are essential questions to practice if you're studying for this topic._

- [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
- [Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)
- [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)
- [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

## Recommended practice questions

_These are recommended questions to practice after you have studied for the topic and have practiced the essential questions._

### [Grokking Dynamic Programming Patterns for Coding Interviews](https://designgurus.org/link/kJSIoU?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdesigngurus.org%2Fcourse%3Fcourseid%3Dgrokking-dynamic-programming)

Brought to you by the same folks behind the famous ["Grokking the Coding Interview"](https://designgurus.org/link/kJSIoU?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdesigngurus.org%2Fcourse%3Fcourseid%3Dgrokking-the-coding-interview), this is one of the rare few courses focused on helping you get better at Dynamic Programming questions. If you are interviewing for companies who are famous for asking Dynamic Programming questions (-cough- Google -cough-), this course should be helpful.
