Queue
==

- Implement a Queue class from scratch with an existing bug, the bug is that it cannot take more than 5 elements.
- Implement a Queue using two stacks. You may only use the standard `push()`, `pop()`, and `peek()` operations traditionally available to stacks. You do not need to implement the stack yourself (i.e. an array can be used to simulate a stack).
