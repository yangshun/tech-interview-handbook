Interviewing is a skill that you can get better at. The steps mentioned above can be rehearsed over and over again until you have fully internalized them and following those steps become second nature to you. A good way to practice is to find a friend to partner with and the both of you can take turns to interview each other.

An important aspect of a mock interview is the right interviewer so that you get the right feedback. That's exactly where [enginEBogie](https://enginebogie.com/) stands out. The kind of interviewers you will find there are top notch thus helping you the best in your interview preparation. They provide you with detailed feedback on both your strengths and improvement areas. These are vetted interviewers who have been taking interviews in their own organizations too. This ensures that the experience you get is the same as what you would get in a real interview. You get to (choose your own interviewer)[https://enginebogie.com/find/experts]. There are lots of interviewers from all FAANG companies. 

## [interviewing.io](https://iio.sh/r/DMCa)

A great resource for practicing mock coding interviews would be [interviewing.io](https://iio.sh/r/DMCa). [interviewing.io](https://iio.sh/r/DMCa) provides anonymous practice technical interviews with Google and Facebook engineers, which can lead to real jobs and internships. By virtue of being anonymous during the interview, the inclusive interview process is de-biased and low risk.

Doing well in your mock interviews will unlock the jobs page and allow candidates to book interviews (also anonymously) with top companies like Uber, Lyft, Quora, Asana and more. You can also book mock interviews for more specific roles such as Mobile, Front End, Engineering Management. For those who are totally new to technical interviews, you can even view [recorded interviews](https://interviewing.io/recordings) and see how phone interviews are like. Read more about them [here](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/interviewing-io-hopes-to-close-the-engineer-diversity-gap-with-anonymous-interviews/).

I have used [interviewing.io](https://iio.sh/r/DMCa) both as an interviewer and an interviewee and found the experience to be really great! [Aline Lerner](https://twitter.com/alinelernerLLC), the CEO and co-founder of [interviewing.io](https://iio.sh/r/DMCa) and her team are passionate about revolutionizing the technical interview process and helping candidates to improve their skills at interviewing. She has also published a number of technical interview-related articles on the [interviewing.io blog](http://blog.interviewing.io/).

## Pramp

Another platform that allows you to practice coding interviews is [Pramp](https://pramp.com). Where [interviewing.io](https://iio.sh/r/DMCa) matches potential job seekers with seasoned technical interviewers, Pramp takes a different approach. Pramp pairs you up with another peer who is also a job seeker and both of you take turns to assume the role of interviewer and interviewee. Pramp also prepares questions for you, along with suggested solutions and prompts to guide the interviewee.

Personally, I am not that fond of Pramp's approach because if I were to interview someone, I would rather choose a question I am familiar with. Also, many users of the platform do not have the experience of being interviewers and that can result in a horrible interview experience. There was once where my matched peer, as the interviewer, did not have the right understanding of the question and attempted to lead me down the wrong path of solving the question. However, this is more of a problem of the candidate than the platform though.
