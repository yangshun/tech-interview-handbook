## What is this?

Carefully curated content to help you ace your next technical interview, with a focus on algorithms and the front end domain. System design questions are in-progress. Besides the usual algorithm questions, other **awesome** stuff includes:

- [How to prepare](preparing) for coding interviews
- [Algorithm tips and the best practice questions](algorithms) categorized by topic
- ["Front-end Job Interview Questions" answers](front-end/interview-questions.md)
- [Interview formats](non-technical/format.md) of the top tech companies
- [Behavioral questions](non-technical/behavioral.md) categorized by companies
- [Good questions to ask your interviewers](non-technical/questions-to-ask.md) at the end of the interviews

This handbook is pretty new and help from you in contributing content would be very much appreciated!

## Why do I want this?

This repository has content that covers all phases of a technical interview; from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful as well.

## Who is this for?

Anybody who wants to land a job at a tech company but is new to technical interviews, or seasoned engineers who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and wants to get back into the game.

## How is this repository different?

There are so many awesome books like [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) and interview-related repositories out there on GitHub, what makes this repository different? The difference is that many existing interview repositories contain mainly links to external resources whereas this repository contains top quality curated content directly for your consumption.

Also, existing resources focus mainly on algorithm questions, and lack in coverage for more domain-specific and non-technical questions. This handbook aims to cover content beyond the typical algorithmic coding questions. 😎
