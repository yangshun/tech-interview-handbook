## What is this?

Not everyone has the time to do a few hundred LeetCode questions. Here are _free and curated_ technical interview preparation materials for busy engineers, brought to you by me, the author of [Blind 75](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU). Over 1,000,000 people have benefitted from this handbook!

Besides the usual algorithm questions, other **awesome** stuff includes:

- [Best practice questions](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/) for coding interviews
- [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/) - the next evolution of Blind 75, bigger and better
- [How to prepare](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-prep/) for coding interviews
- [Coding interview best practices](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-cheatsheet/) - Straight-to-the-point Do's and Don'ts
- [Algorithm cheatsheets and tips](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/) categorized by topic
- [Step-by-step Software Engineer resume guide](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/resume/) to prepare a FAANG-ready resume
- [Behavioral questions](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/behavioral-interview-questions/) asked by the top tech companies
- [Front end interview preparation](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com)

Help from you in contributing content would be very much appreciated!

## Why would you read this?

This repository has **practical** content that covers all phases of a technical interview, from applying for a job to passing the interviews to offer negotiation. Technically competent candidates might still find the non-technical content helpful.

The information in this repository is condensed. Ultimately, the key to succeeding in technical interviews is consistent practice and I don't want to bore you with too many words. I tell you the minimum you need to know on how to go about navigating the interview process, you go and practice and land your dream job.

## Who is this for?

Anybody who wants to land a job at a tech company but is new to technical interviews, seasoned engineers who have not been on the other side of the interviewing table in a while and want to get back into the game, or anyone who wants to be better at technical interviewing.

## How is this repository different?

There are many awesome books like "Cracking the Coding Interview" and interview-related repositories out there on GitHub, what makes this repository different? The difference is that many existing interview repositories contain mainly links to external resources whereas this repository contains top-quality curated content directly for your consumption.

Also, existing resources focus mainly on algorithm questions and lack coverage for more domain-specific and non-technical questions. This handbook aims to cover content beyond the typical algorithmic coding questions. üòé

### [Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions](https://www.designgurus.io/course/grokking-the-coding-interview?aff=kJSIoU)

This course by Design Gurus expands upon the questions on the recommended practice questions but approaches the practicing from a questions pattern perspective, which is an approach I also agree with for learning and have personally used to get better at coding interviews. The course allows you to practice selected questions in Java, Python, C++, JavaScript and also provides sample solutions in those languages. **Learn and understand patterns, not memorize answers!** [**Get lifetime access today ‚Üí**](https://www.designgurus.io/course/grokking-the-coding-interview?aff=kJSIoU)

## Looking for Front End content?

Front-end-related content has been moved to a separate website - [Front End Interview Handbook](https://frontendinterviewhandbook.com).

## Looking for System Design content?

We're still working on System Design content. In the meanwhile, check out [ByteByteGo's System Design Interview course](https://bytebytego.com?fpr=techinterviewhandbook) or Design Gurus' [Grokking the System Design Interview course](https://www.designgurus.io/course/grokking-the-system-design-interview?aff=kJSIoU), which in our opinion are among the most useful resources for getting started on system design interviews preparation.

If you are interested in how data structures are implemented, check out [Lago](https://github.com/yangshun/lago), a Data Structures and Algorithms library for JavaScript. It is pretty much still WIP but I intend to make it into a library that can be used in production and also a reference resource for revising Data Structures and Algorithms.
